Assess, communicate and make decisions using the remaining components. Although guidelines are often expressed in terms of a total GCS score, the trend in whichever of the components (eye, motor or verbal) can be assessed is still valuable. 2. Do not use number to record missing component; use Not testable . 3. Do not report a total score when a component is Not Testable because the score will be low and this could be confusing to medical colleagues. This may also imply that the patient is more unwell than they actually are. 4. It is possible using statistical methods to estimate a missing component from the findings in the other components.
